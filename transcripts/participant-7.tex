\mich Did you feel like you were struggling with anything in particular while you were using the system?

\henco I think the only thing was the crop button was in my line of sight. The cube was between me and the crop button. But it would make sense for me to move the cube to the side, move here and then crop it again. That was the only thing.

\mich So how do you feel about this proposed workflow that this system implements?

\henco I think it's great. I guess once your cube is uploaded to the system its pretty seamless.

\mich Great! And then you have used i-Davie before?

\henco Yes.

\mich So how to you think the two systems compare to each other?

\henco Um, well, so when I used i-Davie I didn't upload anything myself. So usually I would give my cube to be opened up. But I mean it would cut out the middle man. If there was a way for me to take the headset off, use it an put the headset on and then manipulate and maybe load a different cube. Yeah I can see the benefits in this.

\mich The only extra bit of admin around loading a cube onto this system, they just have to pre-processed before you can use them. 

\mich How did you find the quality of the visualisation in the VR space?

\henco Yeah it was great, crystal clear.

\mich No jittering and stuff like that.

\henco No. I mean when I was scaling it, it wasn't a smooth motion. But the data itself was fine.

\mich Okay great, fantastic. That's all the question I have for you.
