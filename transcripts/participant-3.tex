    \mich So I'm just going to ask you a few questions about how you feel about the experience and stuff like that. Okay so what do you think was the main point that you struggled with, well obviously the headset. Did you feel like you struggled with anything?
    
    \sushma No, I think you get used to the headset in time and unfortunately that's not something you can control. But it was fine it was very quick, who you use headsets will get better the more you use it. But no specific thing. Obviously it would be useful to have more features, especially the contrast, because even for just looking at it, it was hard to see the emission lines.
    
    \mich So since you have used i-Davie before, how do you think the two systems compare? 
    
    \sushma Its difficult to comment. I have used it (i-Davie) with much larger cubes, so it would take time to load. But I don't know how that compares, and it also has more features.
    
    \mich i-Davie is definetely the more mature software.
    
    \sushma But it's nice that it can be opened from anywhere, that's very very good. Because then you don't have to come to a machine all the time, you are just at your computer and you can use it. Yeah that's really nice.
    
    \mich That's great feedback. Obviously you've looked at data-cubes in VR, so how did you find the visualisation, the quality of the visualisation?
    
    \sushma I think I can only say that more if there's, I mean, I just felt that contrast could have been better. For example visualising the high density gas, low density features, and the background. I mean its good already.
    
    \mich Yeah, this where we find the things we can work on. And than you so much for your feedback.
    
    \sushma And it is also nice to change the scale like the maximum and the minimum, but that us based on what you want to look at right? Like really faint features or depending on what I want to look at, an option to change the values.
    
    \mich Yeah, so basically more features that's really great feedback to hear.
