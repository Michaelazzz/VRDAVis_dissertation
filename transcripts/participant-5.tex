    \mich So, a few questions. While you were using the system did you struggle with anything?
    
    \nabeelah The most annoying thing is probably initially getting a handle on zooming in and zooming out, and moving the menu away. But after a while you kind of get used to it.
    
    \mich What did you think of the quality of the visualisation? The big floating cube.
    
    \nabeelah It was fine. Was it a masked image?
    
    \mich Yeah, it might just be. Other ones I looked at were quite noisy, that one is masked.
    
    \nabeelah It was great at looking at the masked one, I would like to see what a unmasked one would look like.
    
    \mich How do you think it (VRDAVis) compares to the i-Davie system?
    
    \nabeelah I will say the actual interface, like getting into the VR thing was a lot simpler than i-Davie. The one time I used i-Davie it took 10 minutes to open up the cube and get into the platform because there was an issue with the FITS file. Other than that it was quite chilled. I obviously didn't do everything I did with i-Davie on this bad-boy.
    
    \mich Okay, great. An then what did you think about the integrated workflow between the laptop/desktop and the headset.
    
    \nabeelah That was cool. I liked that a lot actually. I like the idea that i could randomly put on the headset and look at something. Yeah, that was great.
