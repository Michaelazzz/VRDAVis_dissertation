    \mich So I'm just going to ask you a few questions about your experience that you had. Do you feel like you struggled with anything in particular.
    
    \kyra Not really. Just the crop mode at the beginning (they are referring to accidental activation of the crop mode at the beginning of the evaluation).
    
    \mich So just some interface errors and stuff like that.
    
    \kyra I think I clicked without realising. It was through the cube, but that was fine.
    
    \mich What do you think of the proposed workflow. Starting from the laptop and transferring the state to the headset?
    
    \kyra That's quite nice. It seemed to be quicker than loading it into the headset, using i-Davie for that I know takes a while. So it is quite nice to be able to jump between them.
    
    \mich An then, since you have used i-Davie before, how do you think the two systems compare?
    
    \kyra I found them pretty similar, and I presuming this is like a basic version because I know i-Davie has moment maps and crop the cubes but quite similar.
    
    \mich How did you find the quality of the visualisation?
    
    \kyra Good, good. Like I said, just like i-Davie, pretty good. And then also with the low quality cube, I could discern the different intensities, the emissions in the cube, and depth,
