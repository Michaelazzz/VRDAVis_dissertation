\section{System Design and Implementation}
\label{sec:system-design}

% NB be more abstract in this section
% it sounds like you are talking about something that has already been made

% have a diagram of the system at the to
% following paragraphs explain the components
% any diagrams relating to those components go in these paragraphs as well

% explain why we use stuff in the introduction, give context

% explain how everything works in the respective subsection

% what does VRDAVis do
% it visualises large astronomy datasets
% using a server to store and process the data and a client to display the data and allow th user to interact and explore the data through a visualisation
% the server is accessible through the internet
% the client is also accessible through the internet
% the client functions within a web browser
% the client can function on a desktop computer such as a laptop or on a standalone VR headset such as the oculus quest 2

This section explains the design and implementation of the VRDAVis system. 
It outlines the system's structure and delves into how each component functions, some key language and package choices, as well as some key algorithms. 
The full source code can be found at the public GitHub repository for VRDAVis~\cite{VRDAVisGitHub}.

% libraries used in project
The architecture of CARTA was used as a guide for architectural choices and implementation. 
VRDAVis is a prototype proof-of-concept system, with the goal of potential integration into CARTA as additional functionality. 
The architecture was kept as similar as possible to allow the systems to be integrated with minimal changes to both systems.

The system uses the client-server architecture. 
With two main subsystems, the front-end and remote services.
The front-end service only contains the client web browser application.
This application is used on both the desktop computer and the standalone VR headset. 
These remote services host, deliver, and manage the resources and services requested by the client. 
% The data server and the signalling server sub-systems are separate remote systems which serve the client application. 
% The front-end services controls the majority of the system logic, while also being the main point of interaction between the data visualisation and the user. 

% The rendering approach, where a system like VRDAVis renders the data visualization on the client instead of the server, is referred to as client-side rendering. 
% A more in-depth explanation about the rendering approach can be found in Section \ref{rendering-strategy}.

Several libraries were evaluated for the development of VRDAVis. These included libraries for embedding VR environments and rendering three-dimensional graphics in a web browser, web-socket and peer-to-peer connections.
Aspects of these packages and libraries such as functionality, documentation, community support; must be considered before attempting to integrate.
Selecting a sub-optimal package which is not suited for the needs of the system could have potential cascading effects on the overall design of the system and the project timeline.
Many of the architectural and system choices were selected because for compatibility with CARTA's architecture, the relevance of each choice will be explain further in the respective sections.

% More details about the respective subsystems are explained in the sections below.

The main decisions in designing and implementing this architecture is deciding which system function are performed by the respective services. 
Once the system has been implemented, moving a task to a different service could be costly. 
For this prototype system, only one architecture could be tested, because of time constraints imposed on this research project.

% breifly explain the components of the system and how they work with each other
% the user side manages system logic and user interaction

The remote and front-end services, with their respective components, work together to create VRDAVis. 
We explain the functionality starting with front-end service, where the user begins their interaction with VRDAVis.

The web browser application is accessible through the Internet, either on a desktop computer or on a standalone VR headset. 
The interface allows the user to choose from a list of files available on the data server. 
These files are pre-processed HDF5 files that store data at various levels of resolution. 
This allows the browser application to request the same section of a data cube at a higher or lower resolution, and then display the requested data for the user to interact with.

The user can use the file selection UI on a desktop computer or a VR headset, but the embedded VR environment can only be accessed through the browser on the VR headset. 
Once the file has been selected, a low-resolution version of the entire data cube is requested from the data server. 
The data is sent from the data server to the browser application, where it is rendered into a visualisation. 
The visualisation can be viewed from the browser window or from within the VR environment.

However, if the user is viewing the visualisation from a desktop computer and would like to view it from a VR headset, the state of the visualisation can be transferred to the VR headset, and vice versa.
This process uses a peer-to-peer connection between the two devices to transfer the application's state. 
This connection is facilitated by the signalling server, which assists with the pairing of the devices as well as automatically establishing a new peer-to-peer connection. 
The signalling server itself is not involved with the data transfer once the connection is established.

Once the user has entered the VR environment, they can interact with the visualisation using various actions like translation, rotation, and scaling. 
If the user wants to examine a portion of the data cube in more detail, they can select the crop mode from the menu and draw a cube around the portion they are interested in. 
Once the area has been finalised and the crop button has been selected, the application determines which cubelets to request from the data server. 
As they arrive, they are reassembled into a larger cube and rendered. 
The user can continue to select and crop smaller portions of the visualised cubes until they reach the highest resolution level available for the selected file.
