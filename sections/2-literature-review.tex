\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:lit-review}
% introduction goes here
% define topic 
The topics reviewed in this section touch on various fields relating to the development of the VRDAVis system.
This involves reviewing other systems which attempt to create real-time and interactive visualisations of large volumetric datasets. 
As well as other topics which support this process such as analytics, visualisation and rendering strategies.
% These topics relate to the field of virtual reality (VR), visual analysis, data visualisation, and volumetric graphics rendering strategies.
% reasons 
With the goal to gather insight into techniques and methodologies that can enrich the VRDAVis system. 
% but does not go into depth over how the data files are pre-processed instaed it discusses why the pre-processed file are useful 
% Finally, a survey of current systems employed in the visualisation of big data in astronomy is conducted. 
% It's important to note that the scope is confined to these specific themes, predominantly focusing on methodologies and best practices pertinent to the implementation of VRDAVis.
